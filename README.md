🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe Game – Python Project
I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python as a console-based application. The game supports two players taking turns on a 3×3 grid, with features including:

Input validation for player moves

Real-time board updates

Win/draw detection logic

Clean and modular code structure

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

Python fundamentals

Control flow and conditionals

Functions and list manipulation

Game logic and user input handling

A simple yet effective project to sharpen problem-solving skills in Python. 🧠💻
